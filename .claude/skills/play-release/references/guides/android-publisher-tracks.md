## Page Summary

 outlined_flag

- 
 The Google Play Developer API enables uploading new APKs and releasing them to different tracks like alpha, beta, or production.

- 
 You can use a staged rollout on the production track to gradually release an update to a subset of users before a full release.

- 
 The process involves uploading APKs, updating tracks to specify releases, and committing changes for them to go live.

- 
 Form factor tracks use prefixes like "automotive" or "wear" along with the default track name to define the track name.

- 
 Draft releases can be created via the API for later deployment through the Google Play Console.

The Google Play Developer API allows you to upload new APKs for your apps
and release them to different release tracks. This allows you to
deploy alpha and beta versions of your app, which are made available
to approved users. This also allows you to deploy a staged rollout
version, which is automatically made available to a small number of
the app's users. Once you have released the staged rollout version,
you can gradually increase the number of users who get that version of
the app, until you finally deploy that version as the "production"
version.

## Adding and Modifying APKs

- Upload one or more APKs by calling the
Edits.apks: upload method.

This method uploads the APK into a storage "bucket", where it can
be assigned to a "track" to deploy it to users. (If the edit is
deleted or discarded, any APKs uploaded to that edit are also
lost.)

- Release APKs on "tracks" by calling
Edits.tracks: update. You can release
APKs on the following tracks:

- Testing tracks such as "alpha" and "beta"

Alpha and beta versions of the app are deployed to the users
you assign to the alpha and beta test groups. You assign
users to these groups using the Google Play Console.

- The internal testing track: "qa"

Internal versions of your app are deployed to your internal test
track as configured in the Google Play Console.

- The production track: "production"

Releases on the "production" track are deployed to all users. You
can make use of staged releases on "production" track to safely
deploy your release first to a small percentage of production users
and then gradually increase this percentage as your confidence in
the release grows.

Simple-mode users should not put more than one APK to any
track. Advanced-mode users using the multiple APK
support
can upload zero, one, or more APKs to each track.

### Track name for form factor tracks

The track name for a form factor track is prefixed with a specific
identifier.

Form Factor | 
Prefix | 

Android Automotive OS | 
automotive | 

Wear OS | 
wear | 

Android TV | 
tv | 

Android XR | 
android_xr | 

Google Play Games On PC | 
google_play_games_pc | 

#### How to compute track name for a given form factor track?

Common track types like production, open testing and internal
testing track have a well known track name.

Track Type | 
Default Track Name | 

Production | 
production | 

Open Testing | 
beta | 

Internal Testing | 
qa | 

The track name for a given form factor track can be computed as:
"[prefix]:defaultTrackName".
For example Wear OS form factor will have tracks with name: 
"wear:production", "wear:beta" and "wear:qa".

Closed testing tracks are created manually and they have custom
names. So a closed testing track for a form factor with name $name
will have track name of "[prefix]:$name".

## APK Workflow Example

This section describes a typical way the Tracks API would be used. In this case,
we assume you want to upload new versions of the APK for each track, and assign
a number of users to receive a staged rollout version. (In practice, a developer
would be unlikely to take all of these actions in the same operation; instead,
you might update the beta version one day, create a staged release on
"production" another day, and so on.)

- Open a new edit, as described in
Edits Workflow

- Call the Edits.apks: upload method for
each APK you want to upload. Pass the APK in the method's request
body. (This places the APK in a storage area, but does not release
it on a track or deploy it.) The method returns a version code for
each APK you upload; you will use this version code to refer
to the APK when you release it on a track.

- Call the Edits.tracks: update method
for each track that you want to release APKs on. In the request body,
pass a Edits.tracks resource
containing the release you wish to rollout. For example, to release an
APK with version code 88:

```
{
"releases": [{
 "versionCodes": ["88"],
 "status": "completed"
}]
}
```

At this point, the APKs are still not available to users. As with
other edits, the changes do not go live until you commit them.

- Call the Edits: commit method to
commit the changes. After you do this, users on each track will be
given the updated version of the APK. (As with all edits, it can
take several hours for the changes to take effect.)

## Staged Rollouts

When you have a new version of your APK that you want to gradually deploy, you may
choose to release it as a "staged rollout" version. If you do this,
Google Play automatically deploys it to the desired fraction of the app's
users which you specify. If the "rollout" APK doesn't have any issues (such as
crashes, etc.), you might increase the fraction of users who receive that
version; when you are ready, you can deploy that APK as the new production
version.

This section describes the steps you would go through to perform a
staged rollout of an APK, then promote it to production:

- Create an edit, as described in Edits Workflow.

- Upload a new APK to the edit, using the
Edits.apks: upload method.

- Start a "inProgress" staged release on the production track using the
Edits.tracks: update method. Choose the
fraction of users who should receive the new APK. At this point, the APK is
still not available to any end users.

```
{
"releases": [{
 "versionCodes": ["99"],
 "userFraction": 0.05,
 "status": "inProgress"
}]
}
```

- Commit the changes in the active edit by calling
Edits: commit. Over the next few
hours, the new APK will be rolled out to users. The fraction
of users you select will receive the new APK.

Depending on the success of the staged rollout you may then wish to increase
the percentage of users eligible for that release or halt the release.

### Increasing the user fraction for a staged rollout

Assuming you have an ongoing staged rollout at 5%, as described in the previous
section, this section describes how to increase the percentage in the case
where the release is going well:

- Create an edit, as described in Edits Workflow.

- Change the "inProgress" staged release on the production track using the
Edits.tracks: update method. Increase
fraction of users who should receive the new APK:

```
{
"releases": [{
 "versionCodes": ["99"],
 "userFraction": 0.1,
 "status": "inProgress"
}]
}
```

- Commit the changes in the active edit by calling
Edits: commit. Over the next few
hours, the new APK will be rolled out to users. The fraction
of users you select will receive the new APK.

### Halting a staged rollout

Assuming you have an ongoing staged rollout at 5%, as described in the previous
section, this section describes how to halt the staged rollout in the case where
you discover a problem:

- Create an edit, as described in Edits Workflow.

- Change the "inProgress" staged release on the production track using the
Edits.tracks: update method. Set the
status to "halted".

```
{
"releases": [{
 "versionCodes": ["99"],
 "status": "halted"
}]
}
```

- Commit the changes in the active edit by calling
Edits: commit. Your release will no longer
be available to new users.

If you later decide to resume a halted release you can do so by setting
its status back to "inProgress".

### Completing a staged rollout

Once you are happy with your staged rollout and wish to rollout the release to
100% of users you can set the release status to "completed":

- Create an edit, as described in Edits Workflow.

- Change the "inProgress" staged release on the production track using the
Edits.tracks: update method. Set the
status to "completed".

```
{
"releases": [{
 "versionCodes": ["99"],
 "status": "completed"
}]
}
```

- Commit the changes in the active edit by calling
Edits: commit. Over the next few
hours, the new APK will be rolled out to users. The fraction
of users you select will receive the new APK.

### Halt a completed rollout

Assuming you have a completed rollout on a track, as described in the previous
section, this section describes how to halt the completed rollout in the case
where you discover a problem:

- Create an edit, as described in
Edits Workflow.

- Change the "completed" release on the production track using the
Edits.tracks: update method. Set
the status to "halted".

```
{
"releases": [{
 "versionCodes": ["99"],
 "status": "halted"
}]
}
```

- Commit the changes in the active edit by calling
Edits: commit. Your release will no
longer be available to new users or to existing users to upgrade to.

The release that will begin serving in place of the "completed" release will
be the previous "completed" release on the track that has been published and
is not halted. Note that this means that you can only halt a "completed"
release on a track if there has already been one or more "completed" releases
published on the track.

If you call GetTrack or ListTracks while a "completed" release is halted,
the "serving fallback release" will show up as the completed release on the
track where the previously "completed" release was halted.

For example, if you initially had an alpha track that looked like this:

```
{
 "track": "alpha",
 "releases": [
 {
 "name": "2 (2.0)",
 "versionCodes": [
 "2"
 ],
 "status": "completed"
 }
 ]
}

```

and you halted the "completed" release following the steps in this section,
calling GetTrack for the alpha track would return something like this:

```
{
 "track": "alpha",
 "releases": [
 {
 "name": "2 (2.0)",
 "versionCodes": [
 "2"
 ],
 "status": "halted"
 },
 {
 "name": "1 (1.0)",
 "versionCodes": [
 "1"
 ],
 "status": "completed"
 }
 ]
}

```

If you later decide to resume "completed" release you can do so by setting its
status back to "inProgress" or "completed". Note that you can create a new
"inProgress" status release on top of the "completed" release but you will
then only be able to resume the "completed" release back to 100% (i.e. to a
status of "completed").

Note: You cannot halt a "serving fallback release". You cannot halt a
fully rolled out release if the release that would become the serving fallback
release has blocking policy issues.

## Draft releases

Draft releases allow you to automatically upload APKs and create a release via
the API which can later be deployed via the Google Play Console. To
create a draft release on a track:

- Open a new edit, as described in
Edits Workflow

- Call the Edits.apks: upload method for
each APK you want to upload. Pass the APK in the method's request body. The
method returns a version code for each APK you upload; you will use this
version code to refer to the APK when you assign it to a release.

- Call the Edits.tracks: update method
for each track that you want to release on. In the request body,
pass a Edits.tracks resource
containing the draft release you wish to create. For example:

```
{
"releases": [{
 "name": "My draft release",
 "versionCodes": ["88"],
 "status": "draft"
}]
}
```

- Call the Edits: commit method to
commit the changes. Your draft release can now be inspected and rolled out
via the Google Play Console or the API.

## Specifying release notes

When releasing a new version of your application you can highlight what's
new to users by specifying release notes on your release.

To do this use the "releaseNotes" field when supplying a
Edits.tracks resource to the
Edits.tracks: update method.

```
{
 "releases": [{
 "name": "Release with notes",
 "versionCodes": ["88"],
 "status": "completed",
 "releaseNotes": [
 {"language": "en-US", "text": "Describe what's new in this release."}
 ]
 }]
}
```
