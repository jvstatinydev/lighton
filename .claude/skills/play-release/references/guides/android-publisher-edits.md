## Page Summary

 outlined_flag

- 
 The Google Play Developer Publishing API Edits methods allow you to group multiple changes to your app and deploy them all at once using an "edit".

- 
 An edit can contain information about associated APKs and their tracks (alpha, beta, staged rollout), and language and locale-specific versions of the store listing.

- 
 Changes made within an edit are not live until the edit is committed.

- 
 Using the Play Console to make changes while an edit is in progress will discard your current edit.

The Google Play Developer Publishing API Edits methods
allow you to prepare a number of
changes to your Google Play app, then deploy them all at once. You do
this by creating an edit, which holds all the changes you want to
make to the app. The edit holds such information as:

- Which APKs are associated with the app, and a "track" for each APK.

Each is associated with a "track", determining which users see
it. This allows you to provide alpha and beta versions of the app
for your testers. In addition, you can provide a limited-release
"staged rollout" version of the app; this app is automatically
served to a limited number of the app's users (determined by the
rollout percentage you set), allowing you to deploy a new
production version of the app gradually.

- Language and locale-specific versions of the app's Google Play
Store listing

Each locale-specific version of the store listing can contain
screenshots and other promotional graphics, localized descriptive
text, and so on.

Note: Not all the methods
provided by the Google Play Developer API use the new, transactional "edits"
functionality. Methods for the
inappproducts,
products, and
subscriptions resources take
effect immediately, whether or not there is an open edit for the
app. Each resource's API reference page notes specifically whether
the methods for that resource use the "edits" model.
When you first create an edit, the edit is a copy of the current
deployed state of the app. You can then modify the edit by calling the
Edits methods. When the edit is ready to go, you commit it,
making the changes live. You can also abandon the edit at any time,
discarding the changes and leaving your app as it was.

You can only use this API to make changes to an existing app (that
has at least one APK uploaded); thus, you will have to upload at least
one APK through the Play Console before you can use this
API. Furthermore, you cannot use this API to change an app's state
from "published" to "unpublished", or to fill out the legal consents
required for publishing. To publish the app, you have to use the
Play Console.

Caution: If anyone makes any changes to the app through
the Google Play Console while you have an edit in progress,
your edit is discarded and the Play Console changes take effect.

## Workflow

This section shows the typical way you would use the Google Play Developer Publishing API
Edits methods to make modifications to an app.

- Create a new edit, by calling Edits:
Insert and specifying the app you want
to modify.

This creates a new edit of the specified app. The app's initial
settings--the APKs, store listings, expansion files, and so on--are all
copied from the deployed version of the app.

- Modify the edit as desired.

You can make most of the changes which could be made through the
Google Play Console. You do this by calling the
appropriate Google Play Developer API method, and passing the IDs of the app
and edit you want to modify. Specifically:

- You can upload new APKs by calling Edits.apks:
upload. This puts the APK in a storage
area, so it can be assigned to a track in this or a subsequent edit.

- You can assign APKs to tracks by calling Edits.tracks:
update. You can also change the track
assignments for existing APKs by calling Edits.tracks:
patch.

- You can create a new localized store listing by calling Edits.listings:
update. You can modify an existing
store listing by calling
Edits.listings: patch.

- You can add or modify expansion files by calling the
Edits.expansionfiles resource
methods.

These methods make changes to the edit you have in progress, but
they do not modify the live version of the app. You can make
further changes or discard the edit in progress without affecting
the user experience.

Note: Each user may have only a single edit open at a time. If you create a
new edit, any existing edit you may have open is invalidated. In addition,
if anyone commits an edit or makes changes to an app through the Play
Console, all other edits for the app (owned by any user) are invalidated.
If you try to commit an invalid edit, the operation will throw an exception
and have no effect.

- Commit the edit.

When you call Edits: commit, if there
are no validation errors, then all the changes specified in the
edits resource go "live", replacing the current state of the
app. These changes can take several hours to take effect, just as
when you make changes through the Play Console.
