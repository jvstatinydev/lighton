## Page Summary

 outlined_flag

- 
 The Google Play Developer Reply to Reviews API allows developers to view and reply to user feedback for their production apps directly or through customer support tools.

- 
 To use the API, authorization is required through an OAuth client or service account with the "Reply to reviews" permission enabled.

- 
 Developers can retrieve lists of recent reviews or individual reviews, and the API supports translation of review text.

- 
 Replies to reviews can be submitted using a POST request with the reply text (up to 350 characters) in JSON format.

- 
 The API has quotas for both GET (200 per hour) and POST (2000 per day) requests, which can be increased upon request.

The Google Play Developer Reply to Reviews API allows you to view user feedback
for your app and reply to this feedback. You can use this API to interact with
users directly within your existing customer support toolkit, such as a CRM
system.

The Reply to Reviews API allows you to access feedback only for production
versions of your app. If you want to see feedback on alpha or beta versions of
your app, use the Google Play Console instead. Also, note that the API
shows only the reviews that include comments. If a user rates your app but does
not provide a comment, their feedback is not accessible from the API.

## Gaining Access

To work with the Reply to Reviews API, you provide authorization using either an
OAuth client or a service account. If you're using a service account, enable the
"Reply to reviews" permission within this account. For more information about
establishing authorized access to this API, see
Setting Up API Access Clients.

## Retrieving Reviews

When using the Reply to Reviews API, you can retrieve a list of all recent
reviews for your app, or you can see an individual review.

### Retrieving a set of reviews

Use the GET method to request a list of reviews for your app. In your request,
include the fully-qualified package name for your app—such as
com.google.android.apps.maps—and the authorization token you received when
gaining access to the API.

```

GET https://www.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/your_package_name/reviews?
access_token=your_auth_token

```

The response is a JSON string that contains a list of reviews for your app. The
first result in the list shows the user comment that was most recently created
or modified.

In the following example, the first review shows metadata that appears in all
results, and the second review shows metadata that appears only in some results:

```

{
 "reviews": [
 {
 "reviewId": "12345678",
 "authorName": "Jane Bloggs",
 "comments": [
 {
 "userComment": {
 "text": "This is the best app ever!",
 "lastModified": {
 "seconds": "1443676826",
 "nanos": 713000000
 },
 "starRating": 5
 }
 }
 ]
 },
 {
 "reviewId": "11223344",
 "authorName": "John Doe",
 "comments": [
 {
 "userComment": {
 "text": "I love using this app!",
 "lastModified": {
 "seconds": "141582134",
 "nanos": 213000000
 },
 "starRating": 5,
 "reviewerLanguage": "en",
 "device": "trltecan",
 "androidOsVersion": 21,
 "appVersionCode": 12345,
 "appVersionName": "1.2.3",
 "thumbsUpCount": 10,
 "thumbsDownCount": 3,
 "deviceMetadata": {
 "productName": "E5333 (Xperia™ C4 Dual)",
 "manufacturer": "Sony",
 "deviceClass": "phone",
 "screenWidthPx": 1080,
 "screenHeightPx": 1920,
 "nativePlatform": "armeabi-v7a,armeabi,arm64-v8a",
 "screenDensityDpi": 480,
 "glEsVersion": 196608,
 "cpuModel": "MT6752",
 "cpuMake": "Mediatek",
 "ramMb": 2048
 }
 }
 },
 {
 "developerComment": {
 "text": "That's great to hear!",
 "lastModified": {
 "seconds": "1423101467",
 "nanos": 813000000
 }
 }
 }
 ]
 }
 ],
 "tokenPagination": {
 "nextPageToken": "12334566"
 }
}

```

Each result includes the following metadata:

reviewId
Uniquely identifies this review. It also indicates a specific user's
review, since users can write only one review for a particular app.
authorName
The name of the user who writes the review.

 Note: In rare cases, the authorName might
 not appear in a given result.

comments
A list that includes the user's feedback on the app. If this
review includes a title, then this title and the review's body text both appear
in the text element, and a tab character separates the title and body text.
The lastModified element indicates the time at which the user most recently
submitted their review.

If you have already responded to this review, your feedback appears as the
second element in the list of comments.

starRating
The user's evaluation of your app on a 1 to 5 scale. A score of 5
indicates that the user is highly satisfied with your app.

By default, 10 reviews appear on each page. You can display up to 100 reviews
per page by setting the maxResults parameter in your request.

If the list of reviews continues onto another page, the API includes a
tokenPagination element in the response. When requesting the next page of
reviews, include the token element. Set this element’s value to the
nextPageToken value, which appears in the original response.

Note: You can retrieve only the reviews that users have created
or modified within the last week. If you want to retrieve all reviews for your
app since the beginning of time, you can download
your reviews as a CSV file using the Google Play Console.

The following example of a GET request displays the next page of reviews. This
request assumes that the current page of reviews (as shown in the response of
the previous request) contains a nextPageToken value of "12334566". The
request also indicates that the next page should show up to 50 reviews.

```

GET https://www.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/your_package_name/reviews?
access_token=your_auth_token&token=12334566&maxResults=50

```

### Retrieving an individual review

You can also use the GET method to retrieve an individual review. You provide
the same URL as the one used for
retrieving a set of reviews, except that you
also include the review_id corresponding to the review that you wish to see:

```

GET https://www.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/your_package_name/reviews/
review_id?access_token=your_auth_token

```

The corresponding response is a JSON string that contains content and metadata
for a single review:

```

{
 "reviewId": "87654321",
 "authorName": "Joan Smith",
 "comments": [
 {
 "userComment": {
 "text": "This app is awesome!",
 "lastModified": {
 "seconds": "1452114723",
 "nanos": 913000000
 },
 "starRating": 5
 }
 }
 ]
}

```

### Translating Review Text

Review text can be automatically translated before being returned from the
reviews API. When retrieving either a list of reviews or a single review, add
a translationLanguage parameter to the query. For example:

```

GET https://www.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/your_package_name/reviews?
access_token=your_auth_token&translationLanguage=en

```

The translationLanguage parameter can specify a language with or without
country. For example, both "en" and "en_GB" are valid.

If you specify a translation language that is different than the original
text, the system returns the translated text in the text property and the
original text in the originalText property. Here's an example:

```

 {
 "reviewId": "12345678",
 "authorName": "Jane Bloggs",
 "comments": [
 {
 "userComment": {
 "text": "This is the best app ever!",
 "lastModified": {
 "seconds": "1443676826",
 "nanos": 713000000
 },
 "starRating": 5,
 "originalText": "Dies ist die beste App überhaupt!"
 }
 }
 ]
 }

```

## Replying to Reviews

You can also engage with your app's users by replying to their reviews. After
you submit your reply, the user receives a notification, indicating that you
have responded to their feedback.

We discourage the use of automated replies to reviews, with the intention of
updating those replies manually at a later time. Also, although you can reply to
a review as many times as you'd like, the user receives a notification only
after the first time you reply to a created or modified review. The following
table illustrates how the user is notified during your interactions with them:

User-Developer Interaction | 
Notification Sent to User? | 

User writes review; developer submits reply | 
Yes | 

Developer updates reply to original review | 
No | 

User updates review; developer updates reply | 
Yes | 

Note: Because your replies to reviews appear publicly on the
app store page, it's important that you don't include sensitive information
about users when you write these replies.

To submit a reply to a user review, use the POST method. In your request,
indicate that the Content-Type is application/json, and include a JSON
document that contains your reply:

```

POST https://www.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/your_package_name/reviews/
review_id:reply?access_token=your_access_token
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "replyText": "Thanks for your feedback!"
}

```

Note: The replyText that you include with your
POST request can contain at most 350 characters. You should use
plain text in your reply; well-formed HTML tags are removed and are not
included in the character count for your reply. The content that you place
inside well-formed HTML tags is preserved, however.

If your request succeeds, you receive the following JSON string as a response.
The lastEdited element indicates the time at which the API records your reply
to the user's review.

```

{
 "result": {
 "replyText": "Thanks for your feedback!",
 "lastEdited": {
 "seconds": "1453978803",
 "nanos": 796000000
 }
 }
}

```

If your POST request is invalid, however, the response displays one of the
following error codes instead:

400 Bad Reply Request
The replyText is too long or is missing.
404 Not Found
The review with the given review_id does not exist.

## Quotas

As a courtesy to other developers, the Reply to Reviews API enforces several
quotas. These quotas are enforced separately on a per-app basis:

- GET requests (for retrieving lists of reviews and individual reviews) – 200
per hour

- POST requests (for replying to reviews) – 2000 per day

If your app needs to retrieve or reply to a higher volume of reviews than these
quotas allow, send a
request
to increase your app's quota.
